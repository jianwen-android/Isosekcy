# Poly-gamy
A team from the **School of Science and Technology, Singapore**.

## The Team
We are a team of **Sec 3**.

In this team are:
- Chin **Jian Wen**
- Wong **Le Yang**
- **Irman** Zafyree

## Robot Design
We built our robot using the Lego Ev3 Mindstorms

For the parts in the robots, we used:
- 1 Ev3 Brain
- 2 Large Motors
- 3 Ultrasonic Sensors
- 1 Pixy 2 Camera

#### Pictures Of Robots
> *Insert the 6 pictures here*
> 
> *Add a brief captions to each of the pictures*

## Schematic
To follow and prepare us for industry-like work, we were tasked to make **schematic diagram**

**of the electromagnetic components** that we used in our bot

> *Provide brief description*


## Code

### Explanation of the code
Below is the basic idea of our code

From here, we translated our idea in python,

and by using Ev3dev, our Mindstorm is able to use python as a langauage.
